What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Because a git repository needs to be created otherwise the file history is not created by itself.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a temporary space to add files which have been changed but haven't been commmitted yet to the repository from the working directory.
