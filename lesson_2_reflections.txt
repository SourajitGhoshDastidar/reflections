What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Because a git repository needs to be created otherwise the file history is not created by itself.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a temporary space to add files which have been changed but haven't been commmitted yet to the repository from the working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can keep the files which I have changed to make a logical change in the staging area which acts as a buffer space and then commit them together using one commit message all at once. Thus I am makng 1 commit per logical change

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Creating a new branch is helpful when I am designing a new experimental feature which I am not yet sure of. Creating a new branch for it would help design that new feature in a new branch in git while keeping the master branch intact.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams help us viasualize the branch structure by mapping each commit to it's parent and also by branching for each new features added or bugs fixed


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
The result will contain a commit which has changes introduced in both the branches independently merged into one commit. We need to represent it using a diagram because it makes it easier to understand.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Automatic merging helps us merge portions of the code which have remained same while creating a conflict if there are portions which 2 branches have developed independently.
