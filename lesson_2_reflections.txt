What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Because a git repository needs to be created otherwise the file history is not created by itself.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a temporary space to add files which have been changed but haven't been commmitted yet to the repository from the working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can keep the files which I have changed to make a logical change in the staging area which acts as a buffer space and then commit them together using one commit message all at once. Thus I am makng 1 commit per logical change
